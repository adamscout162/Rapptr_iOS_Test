# Rapptr_iOS_Test

# Design Notes
1. Installed with the project is the SnapKit Cocoapod, used to programmatically set UI constraints
2. LoginClient was completed using Objective-C, however Swift is not stronger language so I decided to implement ChatClient in Swift
3. The height of the header is set to 64 pixels, relative to the safe area so on iPhone's with notchs it will appear larger. This is so the button and title have enough room.
